# DeepFlow 

**DeepFlow** is a Chrome extension that preserves your browser context (open tabs + optional note) so you never lose your flow during deep work.  
One-click "Enter Focus Mode" auto-saves everything — interrupt as much as you want — then restore instantly later.

Built as a 2-day MVP with WXT, React, and TypeScript.( It's still in prototype state v2).
